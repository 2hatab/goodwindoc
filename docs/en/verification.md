# Resident verification

Guide for users of house chats: how to pass verification and become a **resident**. After successful verification, chat restrictions are lifted: you can send messages and use all bot features.

## Why verification is required

Only **verified residents** participate in the house chat — this keeps the chat trusted and safe. Until you pass verification, chat restrictions apply. Once your application is approved, you become a resident and get full access to the chat and Goodwin features.

## How to start verification

You can start verification in three ways.

### Option 1. /verify command in the bot

1. Open the bot [@g00dwin_bot](https://t.me/g00dwin_bot) in a private chat
2. Send the **`/verify`** command
3. The bot will start the verification flow — follow the steps below

### Option 2. “Verification” button after /start

1. Open the bot [@g00dwin_bot](https://t.me/g00dwin_bot) in a private chat
2. Tap **Start** or send **`/start`**
3. Tap the **“Verification”** button (“Верификация”)
4. Then follow the verification steps

### Option 3. If you’re already in the chat

If you’ve joined the house chat but haven’t passed verification yet, the bot will show a **“Start”** (“Начать”) button in the chat. Tap it — the verification flow will start (in a private chat with the bot or in the chat, depending on setup).

## Verification steps

Complete the steps in order. The bot will ask for each piece of information in turn.

### 1. Select the chat

Choose the **chat** you’re verifying for (your building’s or residential complex’s house chat) from the list.

### 2. Select the building

Select the **building** (house) from the list, if the chat covers multiple buildings or blocks.

### 3. Enter your display name

Enter the **name** (or nickname) the bot and neighbors will use for you in this chat (e.g. “Alex”, “Maria, apt 45”).

### 4. Enter apartment number

Enter your **apartment number** (or other unit identifier used in your building).

### 5. Attach proof document

Attach a **file** that confirms your relation to the apartment. For example:

- Extract from the real estate register (EGRN);
- Lease or sublease agreement;
- Owner’s consent with your details;
- Or another document accepted by your chat administrators.

Format: photo or scan (image or PDF). The file must be readable.

### 6. Review and submit

- Review all entered data: chat, building, name, apartment, attached file
- If everything is correct — tap **“Submit for verification”** (or the equivalent confirmation button)
- The application will be sent to the chat administrators for review

## After you submit

1. **Administrator review**  
   Your application is sent to the house chat administrators. They check the data and document.

2. **Decision**  
   - If everything is in order — an administrator approves the verification  
   - If something is wrong — the application may be rejected or you may be asked to clarify (the bot will send a message)

3. **Success notification**  
   After approval, you will receive a **notification** from the bot that verification was successful.

4. **Resident status**  
   You become a **resident** of that chat:
   - restrictions are lifted — you can **write** in the chat;
   - **new bot features** become available (find neighbors, requests to management company, etc. — described in other documentation sections).

## FAQ

**How long does review take?**  
It depends on the chat administrators. Applications are usually reviewed within a few days. The bot will notify you when your application is approved or rejected.

**Can I verify for multiple chats?**  
Yes. Verification is separate for each house chat (building): select the chat in step 1 and fill in the application.

**What if my application was rejected?**  
The bot will send a message with the reason (if the administrators provided one). Correct the data or attach a different document and submit again via `/verify` or the “Verification” button.

**I’m already a resident but can’t write in the chat.**  
Send the bot `/help` in a private chat or contact the chat administrators — your status or chat settings may need to be updated.
